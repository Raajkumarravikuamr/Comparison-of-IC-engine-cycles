# Comparison-of-IC-engine-cycles
The Internal combustion(IC) engine runs on three different cycles namely Otto, Diesel and Dual cycle. The efficiency of these cycles could be compared under two conditons.

1. Same heat input and compression ratio
2. Same maximum pressure and heat supplied


For this task we will compare the PV diagram of the otto and diesel cycle. We will find the work done in each cycle. The cycle with higher work done has the highest efficiency under constant heat input. The cycle with the lower work done has the least efficiency and Dual cycle falls in between.
